<h2>openSUSE 13.2: green light to freedom!</h2>


<p>Dear contributors, friends and fans:
<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/?p=18707">openSUSE 13.2 is out</a>!
After one year on continuous improvement in the tools and procedures and many
hours of developing, packaging, testing and fixing issues a new stable release
is here providing the best that Free and Open Source has to offer with our
special green touch: stable, innovative and fun!</p>

<p>
This is the first release after the change in the openSUSE development mode,
with a much shorter stabilization phase thanks to the extensive testing done in
a daily basis in the rolling distribution used now as a base for openSUSE stable
releases. The perfect balance between innovation and stability with the great
level of freedom of choice that openSUSE users are used to.<br/>
